# Hello! I'm Francisco üëã

**Software Developer** with 2 years of professional experience, passionate about building web solutions that solve real problems and create meaningful user experiences.

## üöÄ What I Do

I develop **full-stack web applications** from concept to deployment. My focus is on writing clean, maintainable code that delivers both functionality and great user experience. I enjoy the entire development process - from planning the architecture to implementing the final details that make applications shine.

## üíº My Approach

I believe in **pragmatic development** - choosing the right tool for each job and writing code that's not only functional but also readable and scalable. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new and deliver value to users.

**What drives me:**
- Building solutions that people actually want to use
- Writing code that other developers can easily understand and maintain  
- Continuously learning and improving my craft
- Collaborating effectively with teams to achieve common goals

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies I Work With

**Frontend Development:**
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** - Modern web development with strong typing
- **React** - Component-based UIs with excellent user interactions
- **Inertia** - SPA-like experience without API complexity
- **Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap** - Efficient, responsive styling
- **SASS** - Advanced CSS with variables and mixins

**Backend Development:**  
- **PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter)** - Robust server-side applications
- **Python (Django, Flask)** - Scalable web applications with clean architecture

## üå± Currently Learning

I'm deepening my knowledge in **Python and Django** because I appreciate their philosophy of clean, readable code and rapid development. I'm also continuously improving my **English communication skills** to better collaborate in international teams.

## ‚ú® Why Work With Me?

- **Clear communicator:** I can explain technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders  
- **Reliable teammate:** I deliver what I promise and communicate proactively about any challenges
